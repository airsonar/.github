# AirSonar

At the [Underwater Acoustics Conference & Exhibition
2025](https://www.uaconferences.org/) we introduced a design for an airborne
sonar. This uses a tweeter as a transmitter and arrays of [MEMS
microphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#MEMS) to record the echo.
To see the initial results, you can [read the paper from the
conference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airsonar/.github/refs/heads/main/profile/uace2025_airborne_sonar.pdf).

The hardware designs, firmware and processing code for this project are in the
process of being released as open-source projects for anybody who wishes to
build their own. As this material is tidied and documented, it will be added to
repositories in this organisation.
